My Chili recipe

Obviously you can, and should, fork (or spoon) the heck out of this recipe. Chili can never be bad. It is always awesome. I don't follow this recipe all the time, but this is my go-to.

### Ingredients

* 1lb Ground Beef
* 2 Cans diced tomatos
* 2 Cans dark red kidney beans
* 2 Jalapenos, finely chopped
* 1/2 Red onion, finely chopped
* 2 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder

### Steps

* Brown and drain the ground beef
* In a crock pot, add the tomatos, beans, jalapenos and onions
* When the beef is ready, add it into the crock pot
* Add the spices
* Depending on when you want to eat, choose your crock pot setting (High (you want to eat in 4 hours), Low (you want to eat in 8 hours), Keep Warm (you want to eat sometime this week)) and let the magic happen, stirring roughly once per hour.
* Enjoy!
